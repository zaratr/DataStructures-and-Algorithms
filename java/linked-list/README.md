# Singly Linked List
- Created a singly linked list that inserts, Overrides toString, includes

## Challenge
- Code challenge 5 is intended to focus on implementation of Node class, and lInked list

## Approach & Efficiency
- I focused on using linked list for these implementations. especially insertion of a initial list.
- recursion wasn't as efficient. since insertion at the beginning is relatively fast, then O(n) was used
- space was O(1)

## API
- no api was used for this.

# Singly Linked List
- Created a singly linked list that appends, insertBefore, insertAfter.

## Challenge
- Code challenge 6 is intended to focus on implementation of insertion when traversing a list. the difficulty was to insert at beginning, middle, and end.
- recursion could have been used here but not needed.
