<p>Given a matrix, find the sum of each row.</p>

<h2 id="specifications">Specifications</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Read all of the following instructions carefully.</li>
  <li>Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate a code challenge</li>
  <li>Score the candidate according to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw" target="_blank">Whiteboard Rubric</a></li>
  <li>You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond),  but don’t solve it for the candidate</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feature-tasks">Feature Tasks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ask the candidate to write a function to add up the sum of each row in a matrix of arbitrary size, and return an array with the appropriate values.</li>
  <li>Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.</li>
  <li>Don’t let the candidate get scared by the term “matrix”… It’s just an array of arrays.</li>
  <li>The matrix will always be full of integers.</li>
  <li>Negative values are possible.</li>
  <li>All nulls will be counted as zeros.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.</p>

<p>Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available.</p>

<p>Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to at least convince you that their code works to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.</p>

<p>Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Input</th>
      <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ [1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 7], [1, 7, 10] ]</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[6, 15, 18]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ [0, 1, 5], [-4, 7, 2], [-3, 12, 11] ]</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[6, 5, 20]</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The candidate should draw the input and output as a square of integers.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Record detailed notes on the rubric, to share with the candidate when the interview is complete.</p>
