  <li>Read all of these instructions carefully.</li>
  <li>Name things exactly as described.</li>
  <li>Do all your work in a your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-structures-and-algorithms</code> public repository.</li>
  <li>Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.</li>

<p><strong>Branch Name:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hashmap-repeated-word</code></p>

<p><strong>Challenge Type:</strong> Code Challenge / Algorithm</p>

<h2 id="feature-tasks">Feature Tasks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string</li>
  <li>Arguments: string</li>
  <li>Return: string</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="structure-and-testing">Structure and Testing</h2>

<p>Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.</p>

<p>Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.</p>

<p>Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.</p>
