# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Repository Quick Tour and Usage
Setup Instructions:

Clone Project
 Navigate into subfolder. For example, javascript directory will have *.json for a script to test.

 for starting new projects follow, See [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges), in the Code 301 Setup Guide.

 For Java, navigate into datastructures subfolder and start there as the gradle script will be used. More, [setup instructions](java/README.md)

 For Python, follow this [setup instructions](python/README.md)

 For C++, make sure to follow [setup instructions](c++/README.md)

 For C, make sure to follow [setup instructions](c/README.md)

 Review scripts such as json, makefile to test code.

## Intermediate Code Challenges

Under the `javascript` folder, at the top level, is a sub-folder called `code-challenges`. Further explanation [here](javascript/README.md).

As an intermediate introduction to code Algorithms, there will be code challenges such as regex, and array sorting.

Here is a simple way to get code running.
If you have not already done so, run `npm install` from within this folder to set up your system to be able to run tests using `Jest`

To run your tests

- Change to the `javascript` folder
- run `npm test` to run all the tests
- run `npm test ##` to only run tests for challenge ## (i.e. 01)

## Advanced Data Structures and Code Challenges
Below are my overall understanding of five languages in Data Structures and Algorithms. Further, I've used junit, npm, and more.
