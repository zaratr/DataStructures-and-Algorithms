## Repository Quick Tour and Usage <a name="repository"></a>
Setup Instructions:

Clone Project
 Navigate into subfolder. For example, javascript directory will have *.json for a script to test.

 ### For starting new projects
 -  See [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges), in the Code 301 Setup Guide.
- For ***Java***, navigate into datastructures subfolder and start there as the gradle script will be used. More, [setup instructions](java/README.md)

 - For ***JavaScript***, follow [setup instructions](javascript/README.md)

 - For ***Python***, follow this [setup instructions](python/README.md)

 - For ***C++***, make sure to follow [setup instructions](cplusplus/README.md)

 - For ***C***, make sure to follow [setup instructions](c/README.md)

 *Review scripts such as json, makefile to test code.*

## Intermediate Code Challenges <a name="inter"></a>

Under the `javascript` folder, at the top level, is a sub-folder called `code-challenges`. Further explanation [here](javascript/README.md).

As an intermediate introduction to code Algorithms, there will be code challenges such as regex, and array sorting.

Here is a simple way to get code running.
If you have not already done so, run `npm install` from within this folder to set up your system to be able to run tests using `Jest`

To run your tests

- Change to the `javascript` folder
- run `npm test` to run all the tests
- run `npm test ##` to only run tests for challenge ## (i.e. 01)

## Advanced Data Structures and Code Challenges <a name = "Algorithms"></a>
Below are my overall understanding of five languages in Data Structures and Algorithms. Each will contain answers with CodeFellows code challenges and more. for example, the Java Readme will have Documentation with answers and Big O analysis.
